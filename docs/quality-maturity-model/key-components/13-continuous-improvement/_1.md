### Description

-   The tribe primarily focuses on putting out fires, addressing issues only when they become problematic.
-   There's little to no proactive effort to identify areas of improvement, tech debt, inefficiencies or waste.
-   Feedback\*\*\* processes are minimal. The tribe captures feedback sporadically and acts upon it inconsistently.

### Improvement focus

-   Begin by instilling a culture that values post-mortem reviews after significant events or incidents.
-   Understand the root causes and plan to prevent recurrence.

<small>\*\*\* we use the term "feedback" to refer to all types of feedback, including those from users, the team/tribe, and stakeholders. </small>
