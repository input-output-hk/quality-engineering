### Description

-   Architecture diagrams and design considerations (security, performance, testability, etc) are transparent (standard format) and clearly align with the actual product requirements and long-term product vision.
-   Software Architecture and Design decisions are often documented, but there may be inconsistencies in the application of these standards across different teams/components.
-   Vendors work according to set specifications, but integrations may be challenging.
-   Peer reviews (including the entire tribe) start to occur but are not yet consistent.
-   Occasional use of **product feedback** to adjust design and architecture.

### Improvement focus

-   Embed regular peer reviews in the teamâ€™s workflow.
-   Enhance the feedback loop for product discovery to inform design and architecture.
-   Strengthen the guidelines for vendor integrations.
-   Increase the depth and detail of architectural documentation.
