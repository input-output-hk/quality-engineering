### Description

-   Releases are not just predictable but also optimized for maximum efficiency and minimal disruption.
-   Metrics related to release frequency, success rates, defects, time taken, and rollback incidents are actively monitored and analyzed.
-   The release process is data-driven, with improvements based on feedback from each release.
-   Automated testing, continuous integration, and continuous deployment (CI/CD) ensure high-quality releases.
-   Rollbacks, when needed, are efficient and seamless.
-   A **disaster recovery** procedure is established and regularly validated.
-   Advanced practices, such as blue-green deployments, canary releases, or feature toggling, are used to minimize risks.
-   Deployments are mostly automated, optimized for speed, utilizing parallel processes and efficient resources.
-   Deployment to environments like staging is predictable and consistent.

### Improvement focus

-   Focus on refining automation in the release pipeline.
