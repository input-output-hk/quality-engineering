### Description

-   The tribe enforces a policy that **prohibits the submission of code that hasn't been tested** â†’ mandatory checks are in place at the PR level.
-   Basic coding standards have been introduced, and all tribe members are expected to follow them, but they might not be consistently documented- or agreed upon.
-   There's some levels of automated code quality checks, but the focus is mainly on syntax rather than deep structural quality.
-   Automated **unit (and lower level) tests** are written and maintained for **new code** but without any specific coverage goals or systematic- integration testing.
-   All test failures are investigated and fixed.

### Improvement focus

-   Improve depth and rigor of code reviews.
-   Expand automated unit & integration test coverage.
-   Consistently use shift-left techniques in the development cycle.
-   Code reviews focus also on the test coverage of the newly added code.
