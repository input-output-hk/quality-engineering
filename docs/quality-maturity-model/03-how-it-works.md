# How it works

## The process

:::info

Assess, reflect, act!

1. Assess where you stand on each dimension (initial review).
2. Reflect on your current practices (periodic reviews).
3. Act upon the feedback, laying a clear path toward the next level (continuous improvement).

## Timeline

Below is a timeline that outlines how our projects interact throughout the engagement process.

1. **Introduction (30 minutes)**: A program mentor is assigned to the project. They begin by meeting with project leadership to introduce the model, explain its benefits, and answer any initial questions.
2. **Dimension Owners Selection**:  Project leadership identifies and assigns "Dimension Owners." These are individuals with expertise in the 14 key areas. They will be responsible for assessing their respective areas.
3. **Preparation & Evidence Gathering (30 minutes per dimension)**: The mentor guides each Dimension Owner through a brief preparatory task. This involves understanding the maturity level descriptions, gathering relevant evidence (e.g., process documentation, metrics), and preparing to discuss their findings.
4. **Evidence Review Meetings (60 minutes per dimension)**:  The mentor holds focused meetings with each Dimension Owner. Together, they review the evidence, agree on the current maturity level for each dimension, and identify key opportunities for improvement.
5. **Review Report & Findings**: The mentor compiles the results into a comprehensive report. This report details the maturity level for each dimension and provides actionable recommendations and priorities tailored to project specific needs.

## Continuous Growth, Not One-Time Change

The model is built around continuous improvement, meaning you’ll always have a clear direction for growth. The goal isn’t to overwhelm the team with 
drastic changes but to help them steadily improve with small, impactful adjustments over time. It’s an ongoing journey that grows alongside the team’s capabilities.
