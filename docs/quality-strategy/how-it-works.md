# How it works

## Getting started

This section provides instructions on how to develop and use quality strategies effectively, ensuring that your project teams are aligned and equipped to deliver high-quality products.

The quality strategy tool is designed to foster a structured and proactive approach to quality in software development projects. It ensures that every phase of your product development adheres to high-quality standards, leaving _no detail unconsidered_, thereby improving both the efficiency and outcomes of your projects

### Step-by-step guide

#### 1. Familiarize yourself with the Quality Strategy tool

Explore the Quality Strategy Overview and Template, as understanding these resources will help you grasp the goals, principles, and essential components of this approach. This foundational knowledge is crucial for effectively implementing the strategy throughout the SDLC and maximizing its impact on final products.

#### 2. Develop a product-level quality strategy

Once familiarized with the general approach, develop a specific **quality strategy for your software product**.

The purpose here is to capture and consolidate all the existing actions and processes your team or organization has in place to plan, assure (create & validate), and control (verify) the quality of the software products.

-   **Use the template**: use the Quality Strategy Template provided as a framework to structure your product’s quality strategy. This template will help ensure that all relevant actions, practices, approaches, tools, and responsibilities are considered and clearly defined.
-   **Timely development**: aim to create the quality strategies during the planning phase, ideally before the start of the architecture or implementation phases. This collaborative approach promotes a unified vision and facilitates consistent implementation of the quality strategy across different areas of the project.
-   **Review and understanding**: Ensure the quality strategy at the product level is well-understood and reviewed by all team members. This collaborative approach promotes a unified vision and facilitates consistent implementation of the quality strategy across different segments of the project.
-   **Collaboration and insights**: collaborate with other teams and projects to leverage knowledge and experience. Share insights and best practices to further improve your quality strategies.

#### 3. Address gaps and prioritize continuous improvement

With your project-level quality strategy in place, it's time to evaluate it and identify potential gaps. This is an opportunity to refine your quality strategy and enhance your software development process and the overall quality of your software products.

-   **Identify uncovered areas**: if there are areas in the template not currently covered by your teams, track these as continuous improvement tickets. Prioritize improving these areas, as enhancing quality directly translates to increased development speed. The faster you close these gaps, the quicker your team can deliver high-quality outputs.

-   **Adapt and refine**: establish a continuous improvement process that allows you to adapt and enhance your quality strategy and approach over time. Implement corrective actions, refine existing processes, and introduce new practices to address identified gaps.

#### 4. Extend quality strategy to individual features

Beyond a general product-level quality strategy, start developing targeted quality strategies for each important feature or new functionality. This approach allows for more specific quality control and rapid adjustment to meet distinct requirements or address challenges that arise during development.

-   **Expand to main functionalities**: develop detailed quality strategies for each major functionality planned in your product.

-   **Review and iterate**: ensure each strategy is thoroughly reviewed and agreed upon by all team members involved in the project. This collaborative review helps in identifying any areas overlooked earlier in the cycle.

#### 5. Develop system-level test strategies

Consider developing system-level test strategies to guide the work of test engineers during final product validation.

-   **System-level test strategy template**: utilize the system-level test strategy template to organize and guide the testing efforts of your test engineers. This template provides a structured approach to validate the final product comprehensively.

-   **Integration and execution**: the system-level strategies should align with and support the individual feature-level strategies. They are typically executed in parallel to the feature development to ensure timely identification of issues.

## Roles and responsibilities

:::info

While quality is everyone's responsibility, it can paradoxically become no one's responsibility if it's not properly managed. This is where the concept of **accountability** becomes vital.

:::

The **project/team leadership** is accountable for ensuring that the software meets the necessary quality standards. They are also responsible for the quality strategy and signing off on the quality of the delivered product. **As leaders, it's IO's duty to craft clear strategies for the successful delivery of software functionalities**. Once that vision and roadmap are in place, the next step is to ensure teams are aligned and moving in the same direction. Let's collaborate and lead with purpose.

## Shift left

Most aspects of **quality** should be addressed multiple times within a software development life cycle, but in general, the earlier in the cycle that quality is planned and addressed, the less effort and cost are ultimately required to achieve the same level of quality. This principle, known as shifting left, is critically important regardless of the model.

Shifting left minimizes any technical debt that would require remediating early quality flaws late in development or after the software is in production. Shifting left also results in software with stronger quality, security, and resiliency.

## User-centric high-level software engineering strategy guidelines

Define a project strategy designed to prioritize the end user at every stage of the development process.

-   Define the desired user experience
-   Translate UX into functional requirements
-   Design with technology in mind
-   Implement and test iteratively
-   Quality assurance and testing across the SDLC
-   Launch, scale, expand
-   Documentation and training
-   Measurement of success
