### Description

-   Test results are primarily communicated through informal channels, making it difficult to ascertain the actual quality of the software.
-   Transparency is minimal, and results are often not shared widely within the tribe, limiting informed decision-making.
-   Results may be maintained at individual or team/squad levels but are not shared or integrated across the tribe.
-   Reporting is mostly reactive or only done when major issues arise.

### Improvement focus

-   Identify all the existing tests (manual and automated) within the tribe.
-   Ensure all teams are regularly running tests.
-   Begin documenting test results, even if done manually.
-   Define a standard test results template for consistency.
-   Begin to collate results for both functional and non-functional tests.
-   Begin to track test/code coverage.
-   Begin training teams on the importance of test results reporting.
