### Description

-   Failures are extremely rare; focus has shifted from stability to continuous optimization.
-   Redundant systems ensure constant availability of CI/CD agents and tools.
-   Continuous feedback allows for real-time optimizations; feedback loop is as short as possible.
-   CI/CD pipeline, test automation, and test coverage are sophisticated, efficient, and continuously reviewed and improved based on regular review and feedback.
-   Ability to deploy entirely automatically, including production environments.
-   There's a heavy emphasis on feedback loops, with real-time monitoring, logging, and analytics in place to inform the development teams of issues or areas for improvement.
-   Builds are fully reproducible.
