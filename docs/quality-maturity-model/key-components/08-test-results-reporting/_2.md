### Description

-   Test results have a consistent format and are regularly shared within the tribe/org.
-   Test results are regularly collected and reported but may lack granularity or detail.
-   Test results are usually documented, but primarily for major milestones or phases/releases.
-   There is limited traceability from requirements to test cases and results.
-   There is some distinction between test types/levels and platforms, but there's no comprehensive view.
-   The team may rely on basic documentation during specific stages, such as system or integration testing, but fails to apply consistent reporting - across all phases of the SDLC.

### Improvement focus

-   Begin classifying tests/results by type: functional, non-functional, cross-browser, and by test level (unit, integration, system).
-   Standardize the format and medium for reporting results.
-   Develop initial dashboards or reports to share information consistently at tribe level.
-   Focus on integrating test/code coverage per test level and per product.
-   Work on defining what data is essential for decision-making and improving transparency across the tribe.
