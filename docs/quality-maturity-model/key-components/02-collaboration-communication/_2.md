### Description

-   **Structured communication protocols** are in place, ensuring that teams are well-informed about project statuses, challenges, and updates.
-   Communication channels between teams are established, but collaboration is sporadic and mainly reactive.
-   Collaboration tends to be event-driven, like during major issues or releases, rather than a continuous practice.
-   Decision-making is sometimes shared, but teams lack consistent clarity on the rationale behind them.
-   Roles and responsibilities are clearly defined and followed inside the tribe.

### Improvement focus

-   Promote inter-team activities and workshops.
-   Regularly schedule cross-team meetings or sync-ups.
-   Encourage teams to actively share updates, risks, and challenges.
-   Implement best practices for documenting and sharing knowledge.
-   Begin documenting key decisions (including the "why" behind decisions) and share them within the tribe/org.
