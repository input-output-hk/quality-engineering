### Description

-   The tribe follows a consistent process for reporting test results, with established templates and guidelines to ensure clarity, consistency, and uniformity.
-   Test results provide a comprehensive view across various test types, levels and platforms (cross-browser, per-OS).
-   Reporting is mostly quantitative (e.g., number of passed/failed tests) without much qualitative feedback.
-   Transparency is increasing, and data is regularly shared within the tribe.
-   Test/code coverage per test level and per product started to be collected and analyzed.
-   Clearly defined risks, issues, and dependencies, making them readily accessible to everyone, containing sufficient information for easy - comprehension, and ensuring they are regularly updated with the latest progress

### Improvement focus

-   Incorporate automated dashboards for real-time test results visibility.
-   Start extracting insights and trends from test results for risk assessment.
-   Include qualitative feedback to understand the nature and impact of failures.
-   Implement tools that automate the collection and reporting of test results.
-   Identify and address gaps in test coverage across platforms and test types/levels.
-   Educate teams about the importance and understanding of test/code coverage.
