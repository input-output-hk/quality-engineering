-   There's minimal consistency across teams, leading to siloed efforts, misalignments, redundant work.
-   **\*\*Standard processes** are either non-existent or inconsistently applied.
-   Inconsistencies are prevalent across teams in terms of coding practices, repositories structure, and development processes.
-   Dependencies and integrations are typically challenging due to the lack of consistency.

### Improvement focus

-   Begin documenting current practices, processes, and tools, at the Tribe level, in a common format (Quality Strategy tool - QP, QA, QC).
-   Encourage teams to share and communicate about their processes, practices and tools.
-   Create a baseline understanding of core processes at the Tribe level among teams and tribe members.

<small>\*\* Some of the core processes at tribe level are: onboarding, software development, CI/CD, documentation, retrospectives, vendor integration, quality strategy, defect/risk triaging, tracking and management.</small>
