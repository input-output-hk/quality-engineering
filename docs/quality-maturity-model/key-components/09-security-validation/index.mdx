## Guiding questions

1. **Security Integration**: How well is security integrated into your software development lifecycle, and at what stages are security measures most prominently implemented?
1. **Vulnerability Detection and Management**: What processes and tools are in place for identifying, tracking, and resolving security vulnerabilities within your software, and how effective have they been in the past?
1. **Risk Assessment and Mitigation**: How do you assess and prioritize security risks during development, and what strategies are employed to mitigate these risks?
1. **Security Testing and Validation Methods**: What types of security testing (e.g., static or dynamic analysis, penetration testing) are routinely conducted, and how are the results of these tests used to improve security?
1. **Incident Response and Postmortem Analysis**: How does your tribe respond to security incidents, and what measures are taken to learn from these incidents to prevent future occurrences?
1. **Threat Modeling**: How is threat modeling conducted and incorporated into the design and development phases?
1. **Developer Security Training and Awareness**: What training and resources are provided to developers to enhance their understanding of security best practices, and how is this knowledge applied in your projects?
