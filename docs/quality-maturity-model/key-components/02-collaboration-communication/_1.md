### Description

-   **Communication** between teams and tribes/org is minimal, often leading to duplicated efforts and missed dependencies.
-   Teams within the tribe tend to operate in silos, leading to a lack of awareness of others' activities.
-   **Collaboration** relies primarily on individual relationships and not systematic practices.
-   Collaboration is limited, often happening only when issues arise.
-   **Decisions** are often taken in isolation and aren't consistently communicated to other members or teams.
-   There's a lack of clarity on roles, responsibilities, and decision-making **authority**.

### Improvement focus

-   Promote knowledge-sharing sessions and cross-team meetings.
-   Encourage sharing of updates and issues among teams.
-   Establish primary communication channels (e.g., chat platforms, email).
