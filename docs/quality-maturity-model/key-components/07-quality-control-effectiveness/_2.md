### Description

-   Test engineers show basic adherence to the tribe's Quality and Test Strategy.
-   Routine maintenance of the automation framework is performed, but proactive improvements are limited.
-   The tribe/squads conduct quality control activities, but they are inconsistently applied or lack rigorous enforcement.
-   Basic test planning based on identified requirements, mainly for core and/or critical features.
-   Test cases are derived from requirements with no clear strategy.

### Completeness

-   All **new** user-facing functionalities are validated through automated **system-level** tests.
-   Partial automated coverage is achieved in critical/core areas, but some gaps remain.

### Efficiency & execution

-   All automated **tests are run regularly** (at the PR level + nightly).
-   Failures are sometimes addressed but not consistently. Some effort to maintain tests but it's reactive.

### Review processes

-   Occasional peer reviews involving test engineers and developers at the team level, but not consistent or structured.
-   The tribe is somewhat aware of areas that are not automated but lack a formalized process to capture them.

### Results reporting

-   Test results are regularly collected and reported but may lack granularity or detail.
-   Test Results Reporting are created as needed, typically without a consistent format or schedule.

### Improvement focus

-   Work on improving the alignment with the tribe's Quality and Test Strategy.
-   Increase the extent and depth of system-level test automation.
-   Prioritize consistent reporting of test results.
-   Set regular inter-team meetings to discuss test plans and overlaps.
-   Periodically review and refine core scenarios as the product evolves.
