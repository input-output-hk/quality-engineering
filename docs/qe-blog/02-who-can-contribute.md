Who Can Contribute?
-------------------

**We welcome contributions from everyone at IO**, across all departments involved in any aspect of software products. 
This includes, but is not limited to, team members from marketing, communications, business, product, technology, delivery, and other relevant functions.

For the blog, this means you are encouraged to propose ideas, share suggestions, and submit draft content on topics related to software quality and the broader landscape of Quality Engineering.

While we encourage broad participation, it's important to remember that the blog is an official communication channel for IO. 
To ensure we consistently present accurate and high-quality information, all content undergoes a review process led by the Head of Quality Engineering, who serves as the Directly Responsible Individual (DRI) for the blog.
