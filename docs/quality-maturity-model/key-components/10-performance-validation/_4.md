### Description

-   Performance testing is data-driven and **metrics-oriented**.
-   The tribe collects, analyzes, and uses performance data to make informed decisions.
-   Automated performance tests run regularly as part of the CI/CD pipeline, and any deviations are flagged and fixed proactively.
-   Performance testing feedback is used not just for reactive fixes, but also for proactive design and architectural decisions.
-   Testing environments are fully representative of production systems.
