## Guiding questions

1. **Process Evaluation**: How effectively do our current quality control processes identify and address deficiencies, and what steps are we taking to continuously improve these processes?
1. **Error Identification and Resolution**: What mechanisms are in place for identifying and resolving errors and bugs in your code, and how efficient are these processes in maintaining code and product quality?
1. **Performance Metrics**: Which metrics do you use to measure the effectiveness of your quality control processes, and how do these metrics drive improvements and decision-making?
1. **Preventive Measures**: What proactive steps are we taking to anticipate and mitigate potential quality issues before they arise?
1. **Feedback and Adaptation**: How do you incorporate feedback from end-users, peers, and other stakeholders into your quality control process, and how does this feedback influence future developments?
1. **Team Knowledge and Skills**: How well-equipped is your team in terms of knowledge and skills related to quality control, and what training or learning opportunities are (or could be) provided to bridge any gaps?
1. **Continuous Improvement**: In what ways does your team incorporate lessons learned from the past to continuously improve quality control practices?
1. **Resource Allocation**: How effectively are we utilizing our resources, including tools and engineering talent, in our quality control processes, what strategies are we implementing to optimize their use for maximum efficiency and impact, and how do you determine if these are sufficient?
1. How comprehensive and structured is our approach to system-level testing (especially for new, existing, and critical functionalities), and do we have clear visibility on testing assumptions, limitations, risks, and results?
1. How efficient are our testing processes in terms of time, resources, and consistency? Are test failures addressed promptly and are test cases regularly maintained and updated?
