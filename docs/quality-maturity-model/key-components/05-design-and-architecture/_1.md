### Description

-   Software design and architecture are often ad-hoc and lack clear consistency across teams, with little to no formal **documentation**.
-   Design and architecture are mostly **reactive** and lack integration across different stages of the SDLC.
-   Decisions are made with little consideration for long-term impact or alignment with overall goals.
-   The tribe lacks a consistent approach, leading to frequently changing designs, lack of scalability, and software that's challenging to maintain or modify.
-   Limited or no consideration of vendor integrations.
-   Product feedback is infrequently used in refining design and architecture.

### Improvement focus

-   Start building foundational processes for smoother vendor integrations.
-   Initiate dialogue with vendors to understand integration challenges.
-   Enhance the architectural documentation and make it accessible.
-   Begin collecting feedback related to architectural and design challenges.
