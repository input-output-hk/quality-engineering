### Description

-   The tribe has an ad-hoc approach to development practices.
-   There is little or no adherence to coding standards, and **code review** is either non-existent or infrequent, with minimal alignment with Tribe practices.
-   The focus is mostly reactive, with quality issues addressed post-release/development.
-   Lower level **(Unit) testing** is sporadic or non-existent, leading to frequent defects.
-   Code is often written without consistent style, and there is minimal documentation.
-   Testing is an afterthought, often performed right before release without integration into earlier phases of SDLC.

### Improvement focus

-   Initiate regular code reviews.
-   Introduce unit tests for critical components and scenarios.
-   Start aligning with the Tribe's standard practices.
-   Start measuring **test coverage**.
-   Enforce mandatory checks both at the commit (linters) and the PR level.
-   Introduce the concept of a **shift-left** approach to the team and emphasize its importance.
