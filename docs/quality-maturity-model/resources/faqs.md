## Why is the quality maturity model important?

The ever-changing dynamics of the software industry make it imperative to stay ahead of the curve. By adopting this maturity model, our projects will become more resilient and adaptive, embracing a culture of **continuous improvement**. The model also enables the identification and visualization of the company's **strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities**, leading to **a more streamlined, collaborative, and efficient software development process**.

The model covers the complete software development lifecycle (SDLC), including capabilities to define, design, develop, test, deploy, release, and monitor software products. By evaluating the maturity of these capabilities, the model enables organizations and projects to identify gaps and inefficiencies, streamline processes, and **ensure high-quality software products**.

The model emphasizes continuous improvement, ownership, and quality integration in every development stage, with a focus on operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and minimizing defects and rework costs. It involves the collaboration of different roles within each project to ensure **quality is embedded in every layer of the development process**.

## What does applying the quality maturity model imply, and how does it work in practice?

Applying the quality maturity model involves a non-prescriptive, peer-reviewed process at project level against high-level industry standards and common sense, without enforcing any measures or practices.

**Each project is expected to independently establish and track progress metrics**, focusing on continuous improvement and consistently delivering user value.

The **initial review offers a snapshot** of the project's cpability maturity. It's an opportunity for introspection, allowing teams to start productive discussions on improvement.

This is not about enforcement. Rather, it's about **empowering** each project to chart its own path toward better software delivery.


## How much time does the initial review take?

The initial review requires approximately **one hour per dimension** and consists of a series of interactions between the designated program mentor and the assigned owners of each dimension. Typically, project leadership members (including those from product, delivery, engineering, architecture, and test engineering) are the ones designated as review owners for each dimension.

## What are the anticipated outcomes or goals for the recommended improvements at the project level?

During the maturity review of each dimension, manageable and actionable steps that the project can consider to advance to the next level are identified. These are just recommendations, and it's up to the **project’s leadership** to prioritize them according to their time constraints and priorities.

Once most of the recommendations for a dimension are achieved, a new review can be requested for that dimension. This approach ensures efficient framework interaction and provides the project with a customized list of potential improvements for each dimension.

The **recommended improvements** outlined in the quality maturity model are broad in nature and aimed at guiding the project in its transition from its current level to the next one, with prioritization at the discretion of the project's leadership. These are not mandates but opportunities to collectively elevate IO's practices.

## How is progress tracked?

Through a **comprehensive dashboard**, presenting a radar chart of the current state and a summary review for each dimension. This transparency ensures every stakeholder is aligned and informed.

The radar chart, alongside summary reviews, offers a transparent view of areas of excellence and areas for growth.

## Why should the initial review process involve various key roles instead of being exclusively conducted by the software engineers in test?

In addressing the question of why the initial quality maturity review should involve various key roles beyond just software engineers in test, it's crucial to understand that _while quality is everyone's responsibility, it can paradoxically become no one's responsibility if not properly managed_. This is where the concept of _accountability_ becomes vital.

Quality assurance in software development isn't a task that can be isolated to one phase or handled solely by one group of professionals. Instead, it requires a comprehensive approach throughout the entire software development life cycle, from product requirements to delivery and monitoring.

:::

Each SDLC phase (product design, architecture, implementation, final validation, delivery, and monitoring) _requires dedicated attention to quality_. **By ensuring that representatives or project leaders from each role are involved in the quality maturity review process, we reinforce responsibility and accountability at every stage**.

This collective participation ensures that each role or individual understands and takes responsibility for their contribution to the overall quality of the product.

In essence, involving various key roles in the review process isn't just about diversifying perspectives. It's about **embedding quality into every layer of the development process**. Each participant brings unique insights and expertise, which helps in identifying potential issues early and ensuring that quality is not just an end goal but a continuous, integral part of the development cycle. By doing so, we not only aim for a high-quality product at the end of the cycle, but also build and validate quality consistently and continuously throughout the process.

## Wouldn't it be more effective for the project to go through the rubric and do the review themselves?

This model aims to **minimize bias** and leverage the strengths of **peer-reviewed and evidence-based methods**. Our strategy to efficiently manage our review time includes:

1. Conducting a brief introductory session (30 minutes) with project leadership and prospective dimension owners to set expectations (program mentor, project leadership, dimension owners).
1. Encouraging designated dimension owners to complete a short “offline“ preparatory task (ideally no more than 30 minutes per dimension).
    1. Ensuring they understand the level descriptions for their respective dimensions.
    1. Compiling and sharing supporting evidence to justify a specific level for each dimension.
1. Organizing a peer review meeting (one-on-one discussions between the program mentor and each dimension owner) to:
    1. Confirm the level for each dimension based on the evidence presented.
    1. Identify the future actions to elevate the project by one level in each dimension.

In summary, the essence of this model lies in its **peer-reviewed and evidence-based approach**, which is crucial for effective collaboration at both the project and organizational levels. Therefore, conducting the review unilaterally is not an intended outcome for this model.

## How does this model differ from others already on the market, such as Agile maturity models?
