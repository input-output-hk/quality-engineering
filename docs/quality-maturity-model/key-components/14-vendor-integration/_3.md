### Description

-   A systematic process is established for defining, requesting, and integrating all vendor code/work.
-   The tribe has clear processes to give vendors explicit instructions on how to structure and submit their work to ensure seamless integration.
-   Automated tools are in use to help with the integration, ensuring more consistency and fewer errors. There are protocols for managing merge conflicts and testing integrations.
-   Detailed and comprehensive contributing guidelines are in place. These guidelines provide vendors with clear directions on coding standards, test expectations, and other practices.
-   Vendor work is regularly validated and integrated into the internal testing frameworks.
-   Vendors are required to submit **automated tests** at each level with their code. There is an initial review process in place for evaluating the quality, consistency, completeness, efficiency and stability of these tests.
-   The tribe's software architecture has defined modules or interfaces specifically for vendor integration. This structure ensures that vendor contributions fit more seamlessly into the overall system. However, occasional mismatches might still arise, requiring manual interventions.
-   The software architecture is highly modular and adaptable, allowing for efficient vendor integrations.
-   Continuous feedback loops exist between the tribe and vendors, ensuring architectural coherence. Any changes in the architecture are promptly communicated to vendors, minimizing integration issues.
-   Risk management strategies are formalized to cover contingencies in case of vendor-related challenges (critical failures, delays in vendor-delivered functionalities, or vendor discontinuity).

### Improvement focus

-   Improve adherence to guidelines and integration consistency.
-   Expand and deepen the test review process to cover broader aspects of the code.
