## Strategy & quality

Strategy in software development refers to a high-level plan targeting long-term goals, aligning with the organization's vision, and balancing technical and business aspects to efficiently create valuable software that meets user needs.

Quality in software products is a comprehensive measure of how well the software aligns with the intended design, satisfies user needs, and remains resilient against various challenges or changes. It's not just about being bug-free; it's about delivering value, ensuring safety, and providing a positive user experience.
