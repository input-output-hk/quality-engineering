## The process

:::info

Assess, reflect, act!

1.  Assess where you stand on each dimension (initial review).
1.  Reflect on your current practices (periodic review).
1.  Act upon the feedback, laying a clear path toward the next level (continuous improvement).

:::

-   **Initial review**: conducted by program mentors with project leaders and dimension owners to establish a baseline understanding of current practices and identify areas for improvements.
-   **Ongoing reviews**: regular reviews and updates to track progress, guided by a radar chart visualization representing various quality dimensions and maturity levels.

## Initial review

Conducted by a program mentor with project leaders and dimension owners to establish a baseline understanding of current practices and identify improvement areas.

### Initial review process

-   **Program mentors**: mentor assigned to the project.
-   **Introduction and training**: 30-minute intro session to understand the model and process.
-   **Dimension ownership**: project leaders appoint dimension review owners for each dimension.
-   **Evidence review**: mentors conduct 30-minute meetings with dimension owners to review evidence, determine current levels, and identify potential improvements.
-   **Summary report**: mentors compile and fine-tune a report based on the peer-review, which is then shared with project leadership and the wider organization.

## Key roles

-   **Program mentor**: facilitate the review process, ensuring consistent application and alignment with organizational goals.
-   **Project leaders and dimension owners**: engage actively in the review process, implement improvements, and champion quality within their teams and projects.

## Time investment

A complete review requires 6 to 16 man-hours (~1h per dimension), primarily involving the project leadership roles.
