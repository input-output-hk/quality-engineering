### Description

-   The release process is well-documented based on the existing requirements and [templates provided by the Delivery Chapter](https://input-output.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CI/pages/4036232190/Release+Process) and consistently followed.
-   **Alignment with Organisational Change Procedures**: Ensures the release process adheres to established organizational protocols for managing changes, maintaining consistency and strategic alignment.
-   Releases occur at regular intervals and rarely deviate from the schedule.
-   Automation is employed for most release tasks, reducing manual errors.
-   Feedback loops are in place, ensuring lessons from past releases are incorporated.
-   The tribe employs techniques like feature flags for smoother rollouts.
-   Automated **rollback** mechanisms and **disaster recovery** processes are in place and constantly validated, ensuring swift recovery in case of issues.
-   Stakeholders are regularly informed about upcoming releases, and there's a structured feedback loop post-release.
-   Deployments are semi-automated and may still require manual oversight.
-   Every release undergoes a rigorous and **evidence-based** validation process, including guided User Acceptance Testing (**UAT**), ensuring high-quality and reliable performance.
-   **End-to-End Evidence-Based Approach**: each release cycle, from requirements to delivery, is thoroughly evidence-driven.
-   Releases are well documented, providing clear documentation, and usage guidelines for the end users.
-   There are clear practices for identifying and managing **risks** during the release process.

### Improvement focus

-   Ensure **rollback** strategies and **disaster recovery** processes are in place.
-   Focus on refining automation and integrating more robust testing into the release pipeline.
-   Implement advanced deployment strategies like blue-green or canary deployments.
-   Engage in root cause analysis for any release failures.
