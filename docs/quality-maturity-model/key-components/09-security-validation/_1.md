### Description

-   The tribe lacks a systematic approach to security testing.
-   There is little to no formal understanding of security requirements, and testing for security vulnerabilities is inconsistent.
-   Security vulnerabilities are often discovered post-development or accidentally.
-   No formalized security testing tools or processes are in place.
-   There's no clear **ownership** or responsibility for the security approach at the product level.
