### Description

-   The tribe recognizes the importance of performance testing and has begun to define basic performance criteria.
-   Basic performance tests, such as load tests, are performed, mainly during the final stages of the development cycle.
-   Basic tools for performance testing are introduced, but usage is inconsistent.
-   There's a limited understanding of performance benchmarks, and results are documented but might not be systematically analyzed.
-   Performance issues might still be identified late in the development process.
-   Test environments are identified, but they may not be fully representative of the production environment.
