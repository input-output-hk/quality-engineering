Blog posts should focus on sharing helpful information with the audience. When you suggest or write a blog post, 
always consider what it offers the reader. If the post is more internal-focused or a personal essay of sorts, it is 
likely not a fit for this blog (but could go on Confluence or on your personal LinkedIn page).

### 1\. Propose Your Idea

*   Before drafting a blog post, contributors should submit a blog proposal. This ensures alignment with the QE blog's goals and prevents overlap with other content.

*   The proposal should include:

	*   **Proposed Title**: A concise, descriptive title.

	*   **Summary**: 2-3 sentences summarizing the core idea of the post.

	*   **Audience**: Specify the target audience (e.g., developers, testers, leadership, etc.).

	*   **Key Takeaways:** Outline 3-5 takeaways for readers.

	*   **Draft Timeline**: Suggested timeline for draft submission and publication.


**Where to submit:** Reach out to the QE blog editorial team or use the internal [blog submission template](https://github.com/input-output-hk/quality-engineering/issues/new?assignees=&labels=blog&projects=&template=blog.md&title=) 
to submit your proposal to the blog editorial team.

The QE blog editorial team will review the pitch and either a) greenlight the post, b) offer suggestions for improvements, 
or c) explain why the idea might not be a fit for the blog and offer other ideas for getting the message out.

### 2\. Draft the Blog Post

*   Once the proposal is approved, the contributor can start drafting the blog post.


### 3\. Draft Review and Editing

*   Submit the completed draft to the QE blog editorial team for review.

*   The review process will check:

	*   Grammar, spelling, and clarity

	*   Adherence to IOG brand tone and style

	*   Accuracy and technical correctness

	*   Content length and readability

*   The editorial team may request revisions before the post is approved for publication.


### 4\. Publication

Once the draft is finalized and approved:

*   The blog post will be scheduled for publication based on content planning and calendar.

*   The QE blog editorial team will handle the actual publishing process on the platform ([Blog | Quality Engineering](https://input-output-hk.github.io/quality-engineering/blog/)).

*   The author will be credited on the post, with a short bio (optional).

*   The contributor will be notified of the expected publication date.
