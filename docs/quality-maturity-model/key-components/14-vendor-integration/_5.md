### Description

-   The process of integrating vendor code is continuously improved based on metrics and feedback, achieving near-seamless integration.
-   Contributing guidelines are not just available but are embedded as part of the vendor's workflow, with tools in place to ensure automatic adherence.
-   The tribe not only reviews the tests but collaborates with vendors in a proactive manner to ensure the highest quality of both functional and non-functional tests.
-   Continuous improvement practices are applied to test processes, ensuring they remain up-to-date and efficient.
-   The tribe's software architecture is built with vendor collaboration in mind. Architecture and design patterns are co-created with vendor input, promoting a symbiotic relationship. This ensures that vendor work is not just accommodated but is an integral part of the system's evolution and growth.
