## Guiding questions

1. How are test results currently reported in your team or organization, and what is the level of detail and frequency of these reports?
1. How well are test results integrated with other software development processes (like CI/CD, defect tracking) and effectively communicated to different stakeholders, including both technical and non-technical members?
1. To what extent is automation used in the generation, analysis, and dissemination of test results, and what tools are currently in place to support these processes?
1. Beyond basic test results, what additional quality metrics (like code quality, usability, security vulnerabilities, risks, defect leakage) are being tracked, and how comprehensive is the test coverage across different test types and levels?
1. How are test results utilized in identifying, assessing, and managing risks, and in driving continuous improvement in your software development processes?
