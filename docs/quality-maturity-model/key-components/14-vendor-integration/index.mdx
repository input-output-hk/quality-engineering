## Guiding questions

1. **Quality Assurance**: What measures are in place to ensure that the quality of work delivered by vendors meets our project standards and requirements?
1. **Quality Control and Testing**: What measures are in place to ensure the quality of the functionalities developed by external vendors, and how is their work integrated into our testing routines?
1. **Integration and Implementation**: What processes are in place to seamlessly integrate vendor-developed functionalities into our existing systems and workflows?
1. **Risk Management and Contingency Planning**: What risk management strategies do we employ when working with external vendors, and how do we plan for contingencies in case of vendor-related challenges (critical failures, delays in vendor-delivered functionalities, or vendor discontinuity)?
1. **Communication and Coordination**: How effective are our communication and coordination mechanisms with vendors, and what improvements can be made for more seamless interactions?
1. **Knowledge Transfer and Documentation**: How do we ensure effective knowledge transfer and proper documentation of vendor-developed functionalities for future maintenance and scalability?
1. **Performance Evaluation and Feedback Loop**: What methods are used to regularly evaluate vendor performance and how is feedback communicated and implemented to foster continuous improvement?
