### Description

-   User stories and acceptance criteria are formalized, although they might lack depth, and detail, and vary in quality.
-   The definition of done is informally agreed upon but not always consistently applied.
-   The tribe sometimes conducts **peer reviews of user stories and acceptance criteria**, but these are not thorough or frequent enough to ensure full clarity.

### Improvement focus

-   Enhance the detail and consistency of user stories and acceptance criteria.
-   Focus on building a shared understanding of the definition of done within the team.
-   Encourage internal discussions to clarify doubts and share insights about requirements.
-   Introduce regular sync-ups with the tribe to clarify ambiguities.
