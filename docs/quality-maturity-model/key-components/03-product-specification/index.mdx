## Generics

**\*\* Product specifications** (often referred to as "spec" or "software specs") are detailed descriptions of the software's requirements, features, behaviors, and constraints. They provide a clear and agreed-upon blueprint for both the developers and stakeholders, ensuring that the end product meets the intended design and functionality. Here's a brief overview:

1. **Requirements**: What the software must achieve. This could be in terms of functionalities, capabilities, and supported platforms.
1. **Features**: Detailed descriptions of functionalities, which often include user stories or use cases to depict how an end-user will interact with the software.
1. **Behavior**: Descriptions of how the software should react to different inputs, scenarios, or events. This can also encompass error handling and expected performance metrics.
1. **Design Constraints**: Limitations or conditions that the software must operate within. This might include hardware limitations, operating systems, or third-party integrations.
1. **Interface Descriptions**: Details about how the software will interact with other systems, APIs, or modules.
1. **Performance Metrics**: Expected response times, throughput rates, and other performance-related criteria.
1. **Safety and Security Requirements**: Standards and protocols for ensuring the software is secure from threats and operates safely without causing harm or data loss.

A well-defined product specification ensures that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the software's goals, thus reducing ambiguities and potential misalignments during the development phase.

## Guiding questions

1. Are we staying focused on delivering value, or are we being sidetracked by "nice-to-haves"?
1. Does the product specification concisely define its scope, objectives, and measurable goals?
1. Who are the primary users, and how does the product meet key market needs and stand out from competitors?
1. Are technical, scalability, performance, security, and user experience (UX/UI) specifications comprehensive and well-documented?
1. How is customer feedback incorporated to enhance the product, and how does the product align with broader business strategies and market trends?
1. How does the tribe maintain ongoing product discovery and market monitoring to ensure our product continues to stay relevant in the market?
