## Audience

:::info

Software quality must be visible to promote a quality mindset that improves everyone's individual choices, ultimately minimizing complexity, risk, waste, and suffering.

:::

The main audience for this document is anybody involved in the software development life cycle (SDLC) in any capacity, including project, product, delivery, engineering, management, and stakeholder roles.

Readers are not expected to be experts in software development in order to understand it, but such expertise is required to implement its recommended practices and guidelines.

**Note**: you're encouraged to provide feedback on the quality strategy tool at any time, especially as you implement it within your own team/project. Having input from a variety of teams will be particularly helpful to refine and revise the strategy.

## Introduction

:::info

The **quality strategy** is a holistic plan outlining the projectâ€™s approach to build in and validate quality throughout the software development life cycle (SDLC). The strategy involves both a forward and backward-looking perspective, allowing projects and organizations to aim for optimal outcomes while also ensuring that all necessary checks are in place before releasing the new functionalities.

**The Quality Strategy is about envisioning success and paving the way to achieve it.**

The quality strategy tool is designed to foster a structured and proactive approach to quality in software development projects. It ensures that every phase of the product's development adheres to high-quality standards, leaving no detail unconsidered, thereby improving both the efficiency and outcomes of all projects.

The benefit of applying a quality strategy is that a team (or group of collaborating teams) creates easy and clear guidance for everybody involved, about which activities to apply to achieve built-in quality in fit-for-purpose systems.
