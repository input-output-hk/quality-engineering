### Description

-   The tribe largely operates in an ad-hoc manner, with **releases** often being painful, unpredictable or unplanned.
-   Tribes often face unforeseen challenges during the release, with occurrence of post-release defects, leading to frequent rollbacks, hotfixes, or emergency patches.
-   The tribeâ€™s approach to **releases** is reactive rather than proactive.
-   There's no clear **ownership** or responsibility for the release process.

### Improvement focus

-   Document simple release process.
-   Define roles and responsibilities for release management.
-   Identify frequent release failures and their causes.
-   Start formalizing a basic release checklist.
