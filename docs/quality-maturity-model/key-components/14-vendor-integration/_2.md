### Description

-   Basic processes for defining, tracking, and integrating the vendor work are in place, and roles and responsibilities for vendor interaction and integration are formally documented.
-   Some manual intervention is often required to resolve conflicts or inconsistencies, but the process is becoming more repeatable.
-   Basic contribution guidelines for vendors are in place but may not be comprehensive or consistently enforced.
-   There's an attempt to standardize repository structures for vendor work, but inconsistencies still exist.
-   Basic validation through automated testing requirements defined for vendor work, but these are not always integrated into the main testing frameworks.
-   Basic architectural guidelines are provided to vendors, ensuring that their work doesn't conflict significantly with the tribe's established software structure. However, these guidelines might be generic and not tailored to the specific nuances of the tribe's architecture.

### Improvement focus

-   Work towards consistency in the integration process and make vendors aware of the existing guidelines.
-   Begin formalizing the test review process and emphasize the importance of testing.
