### Description

-   The tribe has some form of retrospective meetings but often lacks action items or follow-through.
-   There's awareness of the need for continuous improvement, but it's not consistently acted upon.
-   Retrospectives are organized after major releases.
-   Some mechanisms for identifying waste, inefficiencies, and tech debt are introduced.
-   Structured processes for capturing and tracking feedback emerge. The tribe prioritizes feedback but may face challenges in immediate actioning.

### Improvement focus

-   Standardize the retrospective process.
-   Ensure that every retrospective concludes with clear action items, owners, and deadlines.
-   Start to incorporate basic metrics to measure and monitor common pain points.
-   Introduce the tribe to the basic Lean principles.
-   Start sharing best practices and lessons learned across teams.
