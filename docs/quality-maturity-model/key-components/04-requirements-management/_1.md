### Description

-   The tribe has limited or no consistent usage of **user stories, acceptance criteria**, or definition of done.
-   **Definition of Done** is not clearly defined or understood. There may be inconsistency in what is considered "done" for various tasks.
-   Product requirements, user stories and acceptance criteria are often vague and undocumented, with no formal **review**.

### Improvement focus

-   Introduce the concepts and practices of user stories, acceptance criteria, and definition of done to the tribe/teams.
-   Begin documenting user stories and acceptance criteria for every work item.
-   Ensure every tribe member is familiar with the tribe's product requirements and definition of done.
