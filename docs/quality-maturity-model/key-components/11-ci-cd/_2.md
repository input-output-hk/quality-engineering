### Description

-   Basic working CI/CD pipeline and practices are in place.
-   The CI/CD **agents** are unstable, requiring regular maintenance and often demanding manual intervention to ensure continued functionality.
-   Slow **feedback** from CI/CD processes, long waiting times for build and deploy.
-   **Automated builds** are established but may not occur on every change.
-   Failures are hard to trace back, lacking detailed logging or feedback.
-   **Mandatory checks at PR level**:
    -   Require a smoke test suite to pass before any code merge.
    -   Run tests at the PR level and report coverage and results.
