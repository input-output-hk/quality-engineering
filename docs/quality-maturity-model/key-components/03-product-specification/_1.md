### Description

-   Thereâ€™s little to no alignment on the **product vision**.
-   **Product specifications \*\*** are informal, often undocumented, and may frequently change without thorough analysis.
-   **Product discovery** is often reactive, based on immediate needs rather than a longer-term vision.
-   **UX** considerations are an afterthought, and there's minimal to no user **feedback\*\*\*** integration.

### Improvement focus

-   Establish clear product vision and goals.
-   Start gathering user feedback for insights.
-   Create basic templates and guidelines for product specifications.

<small>\*\*\* we use the term "feedback" to refer to all types of feedback, including those from users, the team/tribe, and stakeholders.</small>
