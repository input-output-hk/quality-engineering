# Objectives

## Establish a baseline for engineering maturity

The **initial review** provides a **snapshot** of the organization/projectâ€™s current quality engineering maturity, enabling introspection and fostering discussions on how to improve.

## Identify strengths and areas for improvement

Understanding the software quality maturity helps to pinpoint **strengths and weaknesses**, rewarding effective practices and addressing areas needing improvement, leading to **continuous, measurable, and evidence-based progress**.

## Promote a culture of continuous improvement

Adopting the quality maturity model enables organizations/projects to set goals, assess effectiveness, and adapt proactively, embedding quality in every development stage to enhance operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and reduce defects and rework costs.

## Embed quality-centric practices

Enhance software development capabilities across the organization/project by embedding quality-centric practices into the cultural and operational framework.

## Chart a course for where you aspire to be

Let's not just measure where IO is, but chart a course for where it aspires to be!
