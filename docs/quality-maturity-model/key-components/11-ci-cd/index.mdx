## Guiding questions

1. **Integration Efficiency**: How effectively and seamlessly does our current CI/CD pipeline integrate new code changes, and what measures do we have in place to ensure this process is both efficient and error-free?
1. **Automated Testing Coverage**: What percentage of your codebase is covered by automated tests, and how do you ensure the quality and effectiveness of these tests?
1. **Automation Level**: To what extent have we automated key processes in our CI/CD pipeline, including testing, integration, and deployment, and what opportunities exist for further automation?
1. **Build Automation**: To what extent are your build processes automated, and what manual steps still exist?
1. **Deployment Strategy**: What strategies are we using for deployment (e.g., blue-green, canary, rolling updates), and how do they align with our overall operational goals and risk management?
1. **CI/CD Pipeline Efficiency**: What are the most time-consuming stages in your CI/CD pipeline, and what steps have you taken to optimize them?
1. **Monitoring and Feedback Mechanisms**: How do you monitor deployments, and how quickly can you respond to and rectify a failed deployment?
1. **Collaboration and Communication**: How well do our CI/CD practices facilitate collaboration and communication within the team and with other stakeholders, and what steps can we take to enhance this?
1. **Monitoring and Metrics**: "What metrics and monitoring tools are we currently using to track the performance and effectiveness of our CI/CD practices, and how do these metrics inform our continuous improvement efforts?
