### Description

-   **Roles and responsibilities** regarding vendor management and integration may not be clearly defined, leading to frequent communication breakdowns and gaps in the final product.
-   There might be no standardized **processes** or templates for communicating and integrating the work done by vendors.
-   There are no clearly defined **contributing guidelines**.
-   **Vendor contributions** are handled in an ad-hoc manner. There's no structured process to integrate vendor work into existing repositories. This often results in inefficiencies and integration challenges.
-   Vendor teams rely mostly on oral **communication** or basic documentation for collaboration which can lead to misunderstandings and mistakes.
-   Vendors provide minimal to **no tests** with their code. Existing tests may or may not run after integration.
-   Limited or no review of the work provided by the vendors before integration. The tribe relies heavily on post-integration reviews, leading to potential inconsistencies and defects.
-   The tribe's **software architecture** doesn't specifically account for vendor contributions. This often results in inconsistencies or challenges during integration, as the vendor work might not be architecturally aligned with the tribe's systems.

### Improvement focus

-   Focus on establishing a basic process for vendor integration and drafting an initial set of contribution guidelines.
-   Start introducing the concept of testing vendor code.
