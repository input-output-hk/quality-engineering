## Introduction

:::info

The quality strategy presents **a path to building better software**, streamlining decision-making, optimizing resource use, fostering better teamwork, and ultimately **delivering more value to users**.
It brings a common language, visibility, clarity, and efficiency to IO’s software development process.

The quality strategy tool is designed to foster a structured and proactive approach to quality in software development projects. It ensures that every phase of the product's development adheres to high-quality standards, leaving no detail unconsidered, thereby improving both the efficiency and outcomes of all projects.

## Objectives

### Clear vision & goals

The quality strategy focuses on defining a clear vision of success and establishing goals to achieve high-quality software. 
It ensures that every team member understands the intended outcomes and works intentionally toward delivering value to end-users. 
By combining both forward and backward-looking perspectives, the strategy helps our teams plan for optimal results while ensuring that 
all necessary quality checks are in place before releasing new features or products. This approach ensures that every task is 
performed deliberately, aligning actions with the desired outcomes.

### A path to building better software

The quality strategy, covering the entire SDLC, helps us streamline decision-making, optimize resource use, enhance teamwork, 
and ensure that software delivers real value to our users**. By prioritizing small, focused iterations and obtaining quick feedback, 
the strategies help our teams concentrate on what matters most, ensuring that each task is completed with care. This approach allows for 
greater efficiency, adaptability, and clarity, resulting in high-quality software that better meets user needs.

<small>** Delivering **real value\*\* refers to focusing on fewer things at a time, making small and frequent iterations, 
and getting quick feedback. It's about finishing what’s started instead of taking on too much all at once. This approach, 
driven by a clear strategy, ensures all energy goes into what really matters. By doing less but doing it well, it is possible 
to build better software that meets users' needs more effectively so the organization stays efficient, adapts quickly, and ensures 
the work really meets the goals and needs it's supposed to, delivering real value every step of the way.</small>

### Proactive quality integration and validation throughout the SDLC

A quality strategy ensures that quality is built into every phase of software development through a forward-thinking approach. 
The quality strategy anticipates challenges early, helping our teams proactively address risks, define test approaches, and assign 
responsibilities. It provides a clear plan for how quality will be assured, validated, and tracked, ensuring that the software 
consistently meets business needs and user expectations. By integrating quality assurance from the start, our teams can effectively 
manage risks and deliver reliable, high-quality products.

### Increased efficiency & reduced waste

By establishing and adopting clear quality guidelines and practices, a quality strategy can streamline operations, reduce errors, 
and lower costs associated with rework and quality control issues.

### Consistent delivery of high-quality products

One of the primary goals of the quality strategy tool is to establish a common, unified, structured approach to software development that, 
like a recipe, consistently delivers high-quality products and services.

### Continuous improvement

Quality strategies help organizations envision and implement mechanisms for continuous feedback and improvement, allowing projects 
and teams to adapt to changing conditions and technologies while improving their processes.

### Company-wide quality mindset and culture

By fostering a proactive approach to quality, the strategies ensure that everyone takes responsibility for minimizing complexity, 
risk, and waste. It encourages every team member to prioritize quality at every stage of the SDLC, building reliable and secure 
products that enhance the user experience. This shared mindset leads to more thoughtful decision-making and a culture of continuous 
improvement across the organization.

## Benefits

### Faster time to market

Quality strategies streamline the development lifecycle by catching defects early, reducing waste and inefficiencies, 
and optimizing time and resources for faster, more efficient product delivery.

### Stronger reputation and brand image

Delivering high-quality software builds trust and establishes a positive reputation for the organization. This can lead to increased customer confidence, improved brand image, and a competitive edge in the market.

### Faster Bootstrapping of New Products

A quality-oriented mature software development culture provides a solid foundation of tools and processes to be leveraged when 
developing new products. This allows the organization to expedite the introduction of these products to the market.

### Common language and enhanced collaboration

Quality strategy would allow Input Output to align expectations and use a **common language**. When everyone speaks the same language, everyone understands each other better, eliminates ambiguity, and **improves collaboration**. A shared vocabulary will ensure that everyone’s on the same page, fostering stronger synergy across all levels and projects.

The quality strategy fosters a culture where continuous feedback and open dialogue about quality processes are encouraged, enhancing collaboration and trust across teams.

### Risk mitigation

Quality strategies help in identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks associated with product or service quality, providing visibility into identified risks and mitigations, ultimately reducing overall costs and increasing ownership and accountability among teams, preventing potential failures, customer dissatisfaction, or reputational damage.

### Better control over outsourced development

When working with external vendors or contractors, having consistent quality practices ensures that they adhere to the same standards as your internal teams, maintaining a consistent level of quality across all products.

### Enhanced clarity for all members

Quality strategies channel the project's focus and streamlines decision-making, while **documenting** these ideas ensures clarity, facilitates communication, alignment, and solidifies collective understanding.
