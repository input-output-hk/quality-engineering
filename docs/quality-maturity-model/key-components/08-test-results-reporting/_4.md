### Description

-   The reporting solution provides quantitative and comparative metrics on test coverage, performance variations, newly added or modified tests, and issue severity across testing phases, all compared against previous releases.
-   Regular audits, reviews, and refinements are taking place to ensure the accuracy, relevance, and continuous improvement of the reporting solution, and the derived insights are documented and made accessible to the tribe and relevant stakeholders.
-   Test results are not just reported but also analyzed for patterns, trends, and insights, empowering the tribe to iteratively and incrementally enhance both their processes and the quality of their deliverables.
-   Comprehensive test result reports are automatically generated and are accessible to the entire tribe/org.
-   Test/code coverage per test level and per product is regularly analyzed and improved.
-   The process of capturing, storing, and reporting test results is largely automated.
-   Result reports offer clear insights into **defect tracking**, highlighting issue trends across various phases.

### Improvement focus

-   Continuously validate the effectiveness of tests and refine based on feedback and evolving requirements.
-   Foster a culture of proactive response to insights from test reports.
-   Refine reporting mechanisms to provide real-time insights.
-   Foster cross-team collaboration to ensure that insights from the test results are integrated into the development process effectively.
