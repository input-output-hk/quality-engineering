### Description

-   **Quality (Assurance = QA) is not just seen as a phase but as an integrated part of the development process.**
-   Developers actively own the quality assurance process. [shift-left](../../../quality-strategy/how-it-works.md#shift-left) becomes a common practice.
-   Automated tests cover both new and existing code comprehensively.
-   **Build** metrics gathered, made visible, and acted on.
-   Core **metrics\*\*** are consistently monitored and tracked throughout the entire SDLC.
-   Advanced tools provide insights into code maintainability, technical debt, and potential vulnerabilities.
-   Technical debt is systematically tracked and addressed.
-   Non-functional aspects like **security** and **performance** are consistently considered and measured, ensuring no degradation occurs.
-   The team members are consistently **dogfooding** the developed apps, especially before and after the main releases.

### Improvement focus

-   Encourage root cause analysis for defects to prevent recurrence.
-   Focus on improving test coverage further, aiming for near-complete coverage.
-   Expand the breadth and depth of automated testing to cover more edge cases.
-   Ensure that team-level development practices contribute significantly to the Quality Strategy at the tribe level.
