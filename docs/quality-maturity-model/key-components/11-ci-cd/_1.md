### Description

-   Code integration and software deployment are done mostly manually, often leading to inconsistencies, errors, or decreased productivity.
-   Frequent **integration** issues (e.g., "it works on my machine").
-   **CI/CD** practices are either non-existent or inconsistently applied, leading to inefficiencies, delays, and quality issues.
-   Manual build and deployment processes.
-   Lack of automated checks at the pull request level.
-   Limited visibility into **build** or deployment status.
