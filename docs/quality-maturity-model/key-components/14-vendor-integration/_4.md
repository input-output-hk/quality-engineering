### Description

-   The tribe employs advanced technologies such as CI/CD pipelines that automatically test, validate and integrate vendor contributions.
-   Integration issues are proactively identified and resolved, minimizing disruptions.
-   Metrics are in place to track the efficiency, speed, and quality of integrations.
-   Contributing guidelines are periodically reviewed and updated based on feedback. Adherence to guidelines is actively monitored, with non-conformities addressed in real-time.
-   Repository structures are not only standardized but also optimized for ease of integration and consistency across all vendor contributions.
-   Besides functional tests, vendors are also expected to provide non-functional tests. The Tribe reviews and assesses the quality of these tests regularly, ensuring they integrate seamlessly with existing frameworks.

### Improvement focus

-   Refinement of the automated integration process, feedback-driven updates to the guidelines, and deepening collaboration with vendors for high-quality code and test coverage.
